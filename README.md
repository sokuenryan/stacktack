# Welcome to StackTack!!
## Overview
StackTack is a financial management application built with React.js.<br>
It helps users effectively manage their financial bill tracking, monitor due dates, and contributions made towards their credit and investment goals using an easy, clean, and simplistic visual interface.<br> 

## Inspiration
The app's inspiration came about as a showcase for a problem solving solution when I realized it would be much easier to log into one app instead of many when needing to check my financial due dates.<br>
When moving my financial apps to one area of my phone for ease of access I realized I had to sign into more than one. 

## StackTack's Benefit to My Life
This app not only has helped me stay on time with credit due dates increasing my credit, but also has become a synergetic tool when budgeting and calculating my finances for the week allowing me to easily see where I need to cut or contribute spending.

## Features

  - Create, read, update, and delete bills with ease.
  - Easy visualization of bills, amount, week they are due, and date due.
  - View a summary of all outstanding and paid bills.

**Calendar Visual**
  - Uses react-calendar.
  - All bills get their name and amount printed to the designated tile per selected date by the user.

**Investment and Credit Tracking and Contribution**
  - Create, read, update and delete listed items
  - Add contribution amounts
  - Banner feature pop up will appear when contributions suprass the initial credit or investment amount placed
  - Congratulations feature will pop up when you complete your goal using Toastify

**Authentication**
   - Uses private routers run through Firebase Authentication system.
   - requires email and password registration.

##Original Designs
**As you can see StackTack origional skeletory design matches quite close to the final product. 
The only difference was that I was going to make it universal with more than one currency. 
There is still thought on making this more universal and perhaps even designed eventually for corporate use. 
For now **this** is the original set design for this app.

# Planned Upcoming Features
## Additional Auth Provider
Will contains a Google Provider sign-in option from Firebase Auth0

## Backend Work
At the moment all user data gets saved to the local storage.<br>
### Note <br>
***All data input areas are intended for ***basic info only*** and **NOT** for the user to create or generate ANY sensative or confidential information***<br>
However, backend is needed so that multiple users ***can*** use the application on more than one browser 
due to the fact that it's client-side only at the moment and all their data can remain separate from other users.<br>
